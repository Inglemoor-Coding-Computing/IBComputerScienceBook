# Introduction

Why did we create this book? With the explosion of Computer Science
material online, students and especially high schoolers looking to
get into computer science may have a hard time picking
the "right guide". Additionally, books can provide tremendous value, as 
they can be used both as tutorials to follow along with, and as a reliable
source for reference for those learning a topic.

More specifically, this book will follow along with the International Baccalaureate Computer
Science curriculum at Inglemoor High School, as we believe there is a dearth of reliable
information on this topic that is compiled in a friendly and accessible manner (and also because
we don't have AP Computer Science :D). However,
we may provide extra information that we think is helpful, or clarifications in case the material
does not make sense as is.


# Why use this book?
We're a team of high school students that have a passion for computer science and a desire to share it with the world. 
We've tried to write this book somewhat informally while still attempting to explain things properly, as we want to 
retain our sense of humor and reach as many audiences as we can. Of course, we might make mistakes, in which case 
please file an [issue on Github](https://github.com/Inglemoor-Coding-Computing/IBComputerScienceBook/issues)
and it will be resolved as soon as possible.
