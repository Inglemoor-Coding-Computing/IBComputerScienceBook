# Chapter 1 - Setup & Overview

## Setup

The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that we will be using in this book is
[Apache Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html). The reason behind
this is that we are able to easily create applications with a visual interface
by dragging and dropping components. Additionally, the IDE comes with syntax highlighting,
autocomplete, aesthetic customization, and a debugger. These tools will be great help,
especially for those entering the world of programming for the first time.

## Overview

Throughout this book, we will learn about computer science using the Java language by creating GUI
programs, solving puzzles, and reading + implementing various topics and algorithm and data structures.
If you're following along with the book during its first edition, we'll be updating it live with new content
as the course progresses through the school year. If you're reading it some time after,
it may already have all the content finished, in which case we may or may not be maintaining it.
